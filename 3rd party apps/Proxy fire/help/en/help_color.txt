Memo Color: Textbox background and Font color

In order to protect netters' eyes, please choose soft colors.
For instance, my favorate choice is:
green background + yellow font
or black background + yellow font

It's said that green is a healthy color, but a white background with a black font is just too harsh for your eyes, and as dull as a black-white television.
